# GA_intro
walk through of a genetic algorithm applied to common petrophysical linear regression
This coded consists of a run file (ga_web_post_clean) and a function file (ga_web_post_functions_clean).
The objective of this example is to walk through the basic steps of a genetic algorithm applied
to a linear regression problem. Linear regression was used b/c the metrics from the LR output could
be compared to that of the GA output.
